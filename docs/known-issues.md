# Known Issues

Running list of confirmed defects/limitations flagged for dedicated
review sessions. Do NOT fix these opportunistically — each is scoped to
its own review.

## 1. computeCoverageGap matches topTag against tech_tags[] only, not domains[]

`computeCoverageGap` (src/engines/evidence-matching/match.ts) checks
`topTag` membership against asset `tech_tags` specifically, but `topTag`
is derived from `domain[]` words (per spec, "most frequent domain/tag").
Pure-domain vocabulary words (Security, eBPF, Chaos-Engineering, etc.)
are never present in any asset's `tech_tags` by convention — they only
appear in `domains[]`. Result: any opportunity whose top capability is a
domain-only word will ALWAYS report a coverage_gap, regardless of actual
evidence fit/strength.

Confirmed via real fixture data: "Security" opportunities show
`coverage_gap="Security"` even when a strength-4 asset has fit=0.517.

Needs investigation — likely the check should also match against
`domains[]`, not `tech_tags[]` alone. NOT fixed in this session — flagged
for a dedicated engine-review session. Do not fix opportunistically.

## 3. Reachability under-scored: missing active-channel credit + twitter/blog double-count — RESOLVED

`calculateReachability` (scripts/github-contributor-scan.ts) did not award the
spec §5 "+2 email-equivalent" for an active direct channel (every scanned user
is an active GitHub contributor), and it double-counted twitter and blog as
+1 each instead of a single +1 category. Active maintainers (e.g. Rahul Jadhav)
scored 2 instead of ≥3. RESOLVED: formula corrected to
`1 + 2·(email OR active channel) + 1·(twitter OR blog) + 1·(followers>100)`,
capped 5; caller passes `activeDirectChannel=true`; 6 regression tests added
(scripts/tests/reachability.test.ts). Recomputed and PATCHed 57 of 94 existing
Contacts records to correct values via scripts/fix-reachability.ts.

## 4. runIntake never read persisted Contacts — RESOLVED 2026-07-14

`runIntake` originally passed `manual: []` for contacts, never reading
already-persisted Airtable Contacts by company — so manual intake always
scored contact=0 and recommended Ignore even when reachable contacts
existed. Fixed 2026-07-14: manual intake now resolves existing contacts
by company match before scoring, via `findContactsByCompany` in
src/persistence/read.ts (exact case-insensitive match on the
`Company: <name>` Notes line — the Contacts table has no Company column;
Airtable FIND is only a substring prefilter, the exact-line check happens
in TS so a shorter name never matches a longer one). No live GitHub scan
is triggered; only persisted contacts are read. Regression tests in
src/persistence/tests/persistence.test.ts (4 tests).

## 5. writePipelineResult always creates Contacts records — duplicates on re-intake — RESOLVED 2026-07-14

`writePipelineResult` (src/persistence/write.ts) creates a new Contacts
record for every ranked contact on every run, with no dedupe against
already-persisted Contacts (unlike Opportunities, which are
fingerprint-idempotent and update in place). Re-running intake for a
company whose contacts already exist duplicates them (observed
2026-07-14: 8 duplicate AccuKnox contact records created on the AccuKnox
re-intake; originals keep the `Company:`/`Followers:` Notes lines, dupes
only carry the opportunity record id in Notes, so findContactsByCompany
does not cascade-match the dupes). Needs a dedupe key (e.g. GitHub URL
or Name+company) on contact writes. RESOLVED 2026-07-14: contacts read
back from persistence carry an optional `existing_record_id` through
findContactsByCompany → fromManual → dedupe → Contact; writePipelineResult
skips the create for those and links Outreach to the existing record id.
Only genuinely new discoveries are created. Duplicates deleted; Contacts
back to 95.

## 2. No CLI mode to import an already-scanned contacts file

`runContacts` (cli/commands/contacts.ts) has no mode to import an
already-scanned/pre-formatted contacts file — it always triggers a
fresh GitHub scan and imports whatever `--airtable--` file is newest.
Worked around this session via a throwaway import script
(scripts/import-contact-scan-results.ts) reusing the same
createAirtableClient persistence primitive. Consider adding an
`oaos contacts --import <file>` mode later. Not fixed this session.
